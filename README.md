# sbom-tool-comparison

There is a general need of selecting what of the many SBOM generating tools we would want to use for docker images. Are they the same? I set to find out by comparing.

## To Do

* Extend to other images
* Compare to upstream project shared info
* Compare to Artifactory Xray
* Compare License Detection
